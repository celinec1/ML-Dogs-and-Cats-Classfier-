# Machine-Learning-Dogs-and-Cats-Classfier-

This is a machine learning project that utilizes Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in conjunction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for this project contains 2000 images of cats and dogs, and the classifier is trained using a 5-fold cross-validation approach.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains 2000 images of cats and dogs, with 1000 images of each class. The images are of varying sizes and resolutions, and are provided in JPEG format.

Approach

The first step in this project is to preprocess the images using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The reduced dataset is then fed into both QDA and LDA classifiers. Both classifiers are trained using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to optimize their performance.
